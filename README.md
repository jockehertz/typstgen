# typstgen
This is a small CLI tool to generate typst template files. The philosophy is that it has opinionated defaults, but they are highly configurable.
This is only available on UNIX systems, since it uses files in the home directory.

# usage
This will come later, once all the features are implemented.

# configuration

## custom templates
You can add your own templates! Just add them to the `~/.typstgen/templates` directory. They should be `.typ` files. These are then accessible by writing the filename with or without the `.typ` extension in the CLI. 

## config.toml
This is not done yet. You will be able to configure lots of things in `~/.typstgen/config.toml`. There will probably have to be wiki entries for that.
